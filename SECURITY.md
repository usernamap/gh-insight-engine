## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of GitHub Insight Engine seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Reporting Process

1. **Email Security Team**: Send an email to [security@example.com] with the subject line "SECURITY VULNERABILITY - GitHub Insight Engine"

2. **Include Details**: Please include the following information in your report:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)
   - Your contact information (optional)

3. **Response Timeline**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide a more detailed response within 7 days.

4. **Disclosure Timeline**: We aim to address security issues within 90 days of receiving a report. We will keep you updated on our progress.

### What We Consider a Security Vulnerability

- Authentication bypass or privilege escalation
- Data exposure or information disclosure
- Remote code execution
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Insecure direct object references
- Security misconfigurations
- Cryptographic weaknesses

### What We Don't Consider a Security Vulnerability

- Missing security headers (unless they lead to a specific vulnerability)
- Outdated dependencies (unless they contain known vulnerabilities)
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of concept
- Issues that require extensive user interaction
- Issues that require physical access to the system

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive data
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

### For Users

- Keep your GitHub tokens secure
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor your application logs
- Use HTTPS in production environments

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.43 â†’ 0.1.44) and will be clearly marked in the changelog.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Security issues should be reported privately
2. **Timely Response**: We commit to responding within 48 hours
3. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We work with reporters to coordinate public disclosure
4. **Credit**: We give credit to security researchers who report valid issues
5. **No Retaliation**: We will not take legal action against security researchers who follow responsible disclosure practices
